=== Section 1 ===
This is the first section of our test file.
It contains multiple lines with varying content.
We'll repeat this pattern several times.

=== Section 2 ===
Here's another section with different content.
This helps test how well our reversal functions handle
repeated patterns and section breaks.

=== Section 3 ===
Let's add some numbers: 12345
And special characters: !@#$%
This will help test various content types.

=== Section 4 ===
Almost done with our test file.
Just a few more lines to add.
This should be enough to test memory efficiency.

=== Final Section ===
This is the end of our test file.
It should provide good coverage for testing.
End of medium test file.
