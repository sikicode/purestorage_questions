"""
A virtual function is a member function in a base class that can be redefined (overridden) by derived classes. 
It's declared using the 'virtual' keyword in C++ and is implicitly virtual in languages like Java and Python. 
Virtual functions enable runtime polymorphism, allowing a program to decide which function to call based on 
the actual type of the object at runtime rather than the reference type known at compile time. 
This is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that supports the principle of dynamic dispatch 
and helps achieve abstraction and polymorphic behavior.
