"""
When calling an API, the typical process involves these key steps:

1. Prepare the request by setting up the endpoint URL, headers (like authentication tokens, content type), 
and request parameters/body if needed
2. Make the HTTP request using appropriate method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the API endpoint
3. Handle the response by checking status codes, parsing response data (usually JSON or XML format), 
and implementing error handling
4. Process the received data as needed for your application
Common tools and libraries like requests in Python or fetch in JavaScript can help make these API calls. 
It's also important to review the API documentation for specific requirements, rate limits, and authentication 
methods.
